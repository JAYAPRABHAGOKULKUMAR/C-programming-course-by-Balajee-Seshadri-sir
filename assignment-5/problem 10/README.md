Problem Statement

Write a loop program to print the sum of two-digit odd numbers whose ten’s digit is 7.

Explanation

Two-digit numbers whose ten’s digit is 7 lie between 70 and 79.

Odd numbers in this range are: 71 + 73 + 75 + 77 + 79 = 375

Approach
1.Initialize a variable sum to 0.
2.Use a loop from 70 to 79.
3.Check whether the number is odd using i % 2 != 0.
4.Add only valid numbers to sum.
5.Print the final value of sum.

Output: 375
