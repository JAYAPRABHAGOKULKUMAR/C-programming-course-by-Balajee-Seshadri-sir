# C Level 4 – Problem 16

## Problem Statement
Write a program to get a number from the user and print whether that number is prime or not.

## Example
Input: 31 → Output: Prime  
Input: 27 → Output: Not Prime  

## Approach
1. Check divisibility from 2 to n-1.
2. If any divisor is found, number is not prime.
3. Otherwise, it is prime.
4. Use goto instead of loops.

## Concepts Used
- Conditional checks
- Modulus operator
- goto-based looping
