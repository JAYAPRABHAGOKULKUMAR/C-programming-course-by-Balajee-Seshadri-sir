# C Level 4 – Problem 17

## Problem Statement
Write a program to get a number from the user and print whether that number is prime or not.

## Example
Input: 31 → Output: Prime  
Input: 27 → Output: Not Prime  

## Approach
1. Initialize divisor from 2.
2. Check divisibility using modulus.
3. If divisible, print Not Prime.
4. If no divisors found, print Prime.

## Concepts Used
- Prime number logic
- Conditional branching
- goto-based looping
