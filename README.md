This repository contains solutions to the programming assignments from the C programming course taught by Balajee Seshadri. The exercises are designed to build a strong foundation in C, progressing from basic syntax and logic to advanced data structures.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each assignment, from `assignment-1` to `assignment-13`. Inside each assignment folder, problems are typically contained in their own subdirectories or named as individual `.c` files.

## Assignments Overview

This collection of assignments provides a structured path for learning C programming. The topics covered in each assignment are as follows:

-   **Assignment 1:** Basic arithmetic operations, focusing on integer division and the modulo operator to manipulate individual digits of numbers without using conditional statements.

-   **Assignment 2:** Introduction to relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`) to perform comparisons and produce boolean-like results (`0` or `1`).

-   **Assignment 3:** Use of `if-else` conditional statements to control program flow based on logical conditions.

-   **Assignment 4:** Looping constructs implemented using `goto` statements to solve problems involving sequences, sums, digit manipulation, and prime number checking.

-   **Assignment 5:** Introduction to `for` loops, covering similar problems as the previous assignment but with a more structured looping mechanism. Includes problems on LCM and HCF.

-   **Assignment 6:** Introduction to `while` loops, providing another fundamental looping technique to solve iterative problems.

-   **Assignment 7:** Introduction to functions, focusing on `void` functions (no return value) to modularize code.

-   **Assignment 8:** Functions that return values, demonstrating how to pass data back from a function to the caller.

-   **Assignment 9:** Introduction to arrays for storing and manipulating collections of data. Problems include sorting, filtering, and performing calculations on array elements.

-   **Assignment 10:** Working with strings as character arrays. Topics include ASCII manipulation, string-to-integer conversion, and basic string operations.

-   **Assignment 11:** Introduction to pointers and their use with functions and arrays. Includes implementations of common memory and string utility functions like `strcopy` and `memcopy`.

-   **Assignment 12:** Advanced pointer and string manipulation, including large-number arithmetic, substring searching, and text processing.

-   **Assignment 13:** Fundamental data structures implemented from scratch, including singly and doubly linked lists, stacks, and queues.

## How to Compile and Run

All programs are written in standard C and can be compiled with a C compiler like GCC.

1.  **Navigate to the problem directory:**
    ```bash
    cd assignment-1/"problem 1"
    ```

2.  **Compile the C file:**
    ```bash
    gcc main.c -o output
    ```

3.  **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./output
    ```
